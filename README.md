# Data Analysis and Visualization Project

## Overview
This project is designed to guide you through a structured process of loading, analyzing, and visualizing a dataset. By completing the tasks, you'll gain hands-on experience with data exploration, statistical analysis, and creating insightful visualizations.

---

## Tasks

### Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset
1. **Dataset Selection**:
   - Choose a CSV dataset (e.g., Iris dataset, sales dataset, or any dataset of your choice).
   
2. **Load the Dataset**:
   - Use `pandas` to load the dataset.

3. **Inspect the Dataset**:
   - Display the first few rows using `.head()` to understand the data structure.
   - Explore data types and identify missing values.

4. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values by either filling or dropping them.

---

### Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
1. **Compute Basic Statistics**:
   - Use `.describe()` to compute statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical columns.

2. **Perform Grouping**:
   - Group data by a categorical column (e.g., species, region, or department).
   - Compute the mean of a numerical column for each group.

3. **Identify Patterns**:
   - Analyze results to identify patterns or insights.

---

### Task 3: Data Visualization
Create at least four visualizations:
1. **Line Chart**:
   - Show trends over time (e.g., sales data over months).
   
2. **Bar Chart**:
   - Compare a numerical value across categories (e.g., average petal length per species).

3. **Histogram**:
   - Understand the distribution of a numerical column.

4. **Scatter Plot**:
   - Visualize relationships between two numerical columns (e.g., sepal length vs. petal length).

#### Customization:
- Add plot titles, axis labels, and legends.
- Use `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for enhanced visuals.

## Additional Instructions

### Dataset Suggestions:
- Use publicly available datasets from sources like:
  - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
  - [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
- The Iris dataset can be loaded via `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`.

### Error Handling:
- Use `try-except` to handle:
  - File reading errors (e.g., file not found).
  - Missing data issues.
  - Incorrect data types.

### Plotting Libraries:
- **Matplotlib**: Customize plots with titles, axis labels, and legends.
- **Seaborn**: Enhance plots with visually appealing styles.

## Submission Guidelines
1. Ensure all tasks are completed with clear explanations and code comments.
2. Include properly labeled plots that provide insights into the dataset.
3. Submit a single Python script or Jupyter Notebook containing:
   - Code for data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
   - Explanations of the steps and insights derived from your analysis.
